# @loomidev/slider

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- @loomidev/core@0.4.1

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9344aad: Export a typed `EventMap` (and named detail interfaces) from fourteen more component
  packages. `@loomidev/react` derives each `on*` callback's type from these, so events on
  these components now carry a typed `detail` instead of falling back to `any`.

### Patch Changes

- 9344aad: Restore every form-associated control to its initial state through native form resets,
  document submitted value formats, and add generated React 18 and React 19 JSX types.

## 0.3.0

### Patch Changes

- @loomidev/core@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fe159c4: First public release of LoomiUI.

  All `@loomidev/*` packages share a single version number and are released together,
  so any set of them installed at the same version is mutually compatible.

  Versions stay in the `0.x` range while the component APIs settle. Until `1.0.0`,
  a minor bump may contain breaking changes; pin an exact version if you need
  stability across upgrades.
