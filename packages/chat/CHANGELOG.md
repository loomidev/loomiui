# @loomidev/chat

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9344aad: Fix accessibility defects found by a new library-wide axe sweep, and retune the theme's
  text tokens so every tier meets WCAG AA contrast on both the light and dark surface —
  `--loomi-text-muted` and `--loomi-text-faint` each shift one step (darker in light mode,
  lighter in dark), which is visible wherever muted copy and placeholders are rendered.

  `<loomi-button>` now forwards an `aria-label` written on the host to the inner control,
  so icon-only buttons can be named the way consumers already expect. `<loomi-progress-bar>`
  and `<loomi-progress-circle>` gain `label`, `<loomi-context-menu>` gains `label` for
  triggers whose slotted content is not text, and `<loomi-chat-window>` gains `locale`.

  Also fixed: `<loomi-autocomplete>` marks its input `role="combobox"` (`aria-expanded` was
  not permitted without it), `<loomi-context-menu>`'s target carries a button role,
  `<loomi-resizable-handle>` reports `aria-valuenow`, and the previously unnamed controls in
  `<loomi-pagination>`, `<loomi-colorpicker>`, `<loomi-filepicker>` and `<loomi-chat-window>`
  now have accessible names.

- 9344aad: Make the last five components with hardcoded English translatable. `<loomi-chat-window>`,
  `<loomi-command-palette>`, `<loomi-data-grid>`, `<loomi-filter-builder>` and `<loomi-video>`
  each gain a `locale` property and route their own copy through the translation table, with
  new `en` keys for all of it.

  The gap was worst for text a consumer could not reach: `aria-label` values baked into
  templates were fixed English with no way to override them, which left screen reader users
  of a non-English page hearing "Select all rows" and "Search commands" regardless of the
  locale. Visible defaults (`emptyTitle`, `placeholder`, `addLabel`, …) now resolve through
  `loomiDefaultText`, so they translate while still yielding to any value a consumer sets.

### Patch Changes

- 9344aad: Document the events that were missing from the custom-elements manifests. The analyzer
  only sees `new CustomEvent("literal-name")`, so events dispatched through a helper or a
  template literal — all nine `<loomi-data-grid>` events, the three
  `<loomi-date-range-picker>` events, `loomi-command-query-change`, `loomi-filter-apply`,
  `loomi-reminder-create`, the `<loomi-chat-window>` attachment and recording events, and
  `<loomi-input>`'s affix events — never reached `custom-elements.json`, and so never
  reached the React wrappers either. They are now declared with `@fires` and generate typed
  `on*` callback props.

  `<loomi-empty-state>` documented a `loomi-action` event it never fires; its JSDoc now
  names the `action` event the component actually dispatches.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fe159c4: First public release of LoomiUI.

  All `@loomidev/*` packages share a single version number and are released together,
  so any set of them installed at the same version is mutually compatible.

  Versions stay in the `0.x` range while the component APIs settle. Until `1.0.0`,
  a minor bump may contain breaking changes; pin an exact version if you need
  stability across upgrades.
