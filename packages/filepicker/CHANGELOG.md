## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9344aad: Export a typed `EventMap` (and named detail interfaces) from fourteen more component
  packages. `@loomidev/react` derives each `on*` callback's type from these, so events on
  these components now carry a typed `detail` instead of falling back to `any`.

### Patch Changes

- 9344aad: Fix accessibility defects found by a new library-wide axe sweep, and retune the theme's
  text tokens so every tier meets WCAG AA contrast on both the light and dark surface —
  `--loomi-text-muted` and `--loomi-text-faint` each shift one step (darker in light mode,
  lighter in dark), which is visible wherever muted copy and placeholders are rendered.

  `<loomi-button>` now forwards an `aria-label` written on the host to the inner control,
  so icon-only buttons can be named the way consumers already expect. `<loomi-progress-bar>`
  and `<loomi-progress-circle>` gain `label`, `<loomi-context-menu>` gains `label` for
  triggers whose slotted content is not text, and `<loomi-chat-window>` gains `locale`.

  Also fixed: `<loomi-autocomplete>` marks its input `role="combobox"` (`aria-expanded` was
  not permitted without it), `<loomi-context-menu>`'s target carries a button role,
  `<loomi-resizable-handle>` reports `aria-valuenow`, and the previously unnamed controls in
  `<loomi-pagination>`, `<loomi-colorpicker>`, `<loomi-filepicker>` and `<loomi-chat-window>`
  now have accessible names.

- 9344aad: Restore every form-associated control to its initial state through native form resets,
  document submitted value formats, and add generated React 18 and React 19 JSX types.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f4689e1: Add `verified` (a primary-colored check-badge corner badge) and `editable` (click-to-replace with a crop dialog, swapping the image and firing a `change` event) to `<loomi-avatar>`. `editable` is built on a new `stealth` mode in `<loomi-filepicker>`, which hides the drop-zone/file list and is driven imperatively via new `open()`/`clear()` methods — useful for wiring file pick-and-crop flows to any custom trigger element.
- fe159c4: First public release of LoomiUI.

  All `@loomidev/*` packages share a single version number and are released together,
  so any set of them installed at the same version is mutually compatible.

  Versions stay in the `0.x` range while the component APIs settle. Until `1.0.0`,
  a minor bump may contain breaking changes; pin an exact version if you need
  stability across upgrades.

### Patch Changes

- 505ea39: Replace raw gray ramps and `#ffffff` fallbacks with semantic Loomi surface, border, and
  on-primary text tokens so components respect dark mode and theme overrides consistently.
