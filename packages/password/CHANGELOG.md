## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- 9344aad: Expand native FormData integration coverage across scalar, choice, checked, range, date,
  and time controls. Input, password, and autocomplete now restore their initial values and
  clear transient state when their containing form is reset.
- 9344aad: Drop bogus events from the custom-elements manifests. A component that dispatches through
  a helper — `new CustomEvent(name, …)` — made the analyzer record an event literally called
  `name` (or `type`), which then showed up in editor completions and framework integrations.
  `pnpm cem` now prunes any event named after a dispatch variable, along with unnamed ones.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fe159c4: First public release of LoomiUI.

  All `@loomidev/*` packages share a single version number and are released together,
  so any set of them installed at the same version is mutually compatible.

  Versions stay in the `0.x` range while the component APIs settle. Until `1.0.0`,
  a minor bump may contain breaking changes; pin an exact version if you need
  stability across upgrades.

### Patch Changes

- 505ea39: `<loomi-password>`: fix its style build script, which was a stale hand-rolled
  copy that skipped the shared Tailwind color-token pipeline every other
  package uses. Theme colors (focus/primary, error, success) silently failed to
  resolve at runtime, so the field's focus ring, invalid border, and error text
  never matched `<loomi-input>`.

  Also: indent the strength requirement list by 10px, turn a requirement's
  check mark and label green (instead of gray/black) once it's met, and replace
  the native `<select>` used for prefix dropdowns with a custom, borderless
  dropdown styled like `<loomi-select>`'s trigger and option list.

- 505ea39: Replace raw gray ramps and `#ffffff` fallbacks with semantic Loomi surface, border, and
  on-primary text tokens so components respect dark mode and theme overrides consistently.
- 5644747: Make the vertical spacing below form fields themeable via a new `--loomi-field-spacing`
  token (default `1rem`). Stacked fields already shipped this margin on most components but not
  all — it's now consistent across every stacked field and overridable from `:root`:

  ```css
  :root {
    --loomi-field-spacing: 0; /* own field spacing yourself, e.g. via a flex/grid gap container */
  }
  ```

  `datepicker` and `timepicker` previously had no bottom margin and now match the other
  fields (a 1rem gap by default). `otp` (standalone/centered) and `colorpicker` (an inline
  swatch) intentionally keep no field margin. The per-instance `no-clearing` escape hatch is
  unchanged.
