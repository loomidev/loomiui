# @loomidev/table

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- 9344aad: Support server-side rendering. Every component now renders to Declarative Shadow DOM
  under `@lit-labs/ssr`, so a page can ship real, styled markup before any JavaScript runs
  — from Astro, Nuxt or Next.js, or as static HTML served by Rails, Laravel or Django.

  Sixteen components previously threw when rendered without a DOM, because they read light
  DOM children, measured layout, or wrote inline styles on the host during `render()`.
  Those reads are now guarded with lit's `isServer`. Components that derive content from
  light-DOM children (`<loomi-select>` with `<option>` elements, `<loomi-tabs>`,
  `<loomi-table>` with a `<template slot="row">`) render without that content on the server
  and fill it in at hydration; passing the same data through properties server-renders.

  `<loomi-timepicker>`'s clock stylesheet is now interpolated as a static value rather than
  a binding, since lit-html cannot bind inside a `<style>` element.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fe159c4: First public release of LoomiUI.

  All `@loomidev/*` packages share a single version number and are released together,
  so any set of them installed at the same version is mutually compatible.

  Versions stay in the `0.x` range while the component APIs settle. Until `1.0.0`,
  a minor bump may contain breaking changes; pin an exact version if you need
  stability across upgrades.

### Patch Changes

- 505ea39: Replace raw gray ramps and `#ffffff` fallbacks with semantic Loomi surface, border, and
  on-primary text tokens so components respect dark mode and theme overrides consistently.
- 7350966: Fixed `<loomi-table>` and `<loomi-data-grid>`'s dark-mode heading/divider colors never
  actually applying. Both used `:host-context(.dark)` to swap in dark-aware tokens, but
  that selector has no Firefox support and isn't recognized by the build's CSS optimizer
  either, so the override silently never took effect in any browser. Both components now
  watch `.dark` on `<html>` in JS (via `watchDarkMode()` from `@loomidev/core`) and reflect
  it as an `.is-dark` class on themselves instead, matching the pattern `<loomi-button>`
  already uses.
- f954123: Update `<loomi-table>` and `<loomi-data-grid>` header background and row-divider colors to a warmer cream/tan tone in light mode (overridable via `--loomi-table-heading-bg`/`--loomi-table-divider` and `--loomi-data-grid-heading-bg`/`--loomi-data-grid-divider`). Dark mode is unaffected — it still falls back to the standard surface tokens.

  Also updates the card drop shadow to a subtler, closer-in style matching the same reference design: tightened on `<loomi-table>`'s `has-shadow` shell, and newly added to `<loomi-data-grid>`'s shell (which previously had none).

- e1e36b7: Make corner radius and control density themeable from `:root`, closing the gap where a
  downloaded theme could recolor components but couldn't reshape them.

  `@loomidev/theme` now ships four public token slots (defaults preserve current rendering
  exactly, so this is additive — no visual change unless you override them):

  - `--loomi-control-radius` (default `0.5rem`) — inputs, selects, buttons, checkbox, tag,
    tabs, pagination, pin, and every field-style control.
  - `--loomi-panel-radius` (default `0.875rem`) — cards, modals, popovers, menus, dropdown
    panels, tables, notifications, statistic/checkcards.
  - `--loomi-pill-radius` (default `9999px`) — pill/`radius="full"` shapes and pill tags.
  - `--loomi-density` (default `1`) — a unitless multiplier scaling control height and
    horizontal padding together (font size stays fixed), e.g. `:root { --loomi-density: 0.85 }`
    for a compact UI. Composes with the per-`size` presets rather than replacing them.

  Precedence is per-instance attribute → `:root` theme override → built-in default: an
  explicit `radius="full"`/`size="small"` still wins over a global token, while the _default_
  preset now defers to the theme. `<loomi-button>`'s `radius` attribute is reimplemented on
  top of `--loomi-control-radius`/`--loomi-pill-radius` instead of fixed Tailwind classes;
  its markup API is unchanged. True geometry (circular avatars, spinners, toggles, chart/QR/
  credit-card art) is intentionally left fixed and does not read these tokens.
