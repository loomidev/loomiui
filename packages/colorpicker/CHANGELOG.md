# @loomidev/colorpicker

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- @loomidev/core@0.4.1

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9344aad: Export a typed `EventMap` (and named detail interfaces) from fourteen more component
  packages. `@loomidev/react` derives each `on*` callback's type from these, so events on
  these components now carry a typed `detail` instead of falling back to `any`.

### Patch Changes

- 9344aad: Fix accessibility defects found by a new library-wide axe sweep, and retune the theme's
  text tokens so every tier meets WCAG AA contrast on both the light and dark surface —
  `--loomi-text-muted` and `--loomi-text-faint` each shift one step (darker in light mode,
  lighter in dark), which is visible wherever muted copy and placeholders are rendered.

  `<loomi-button>` now forwards an `aria-label` written on the host to the inner control,
  so icon-only buttons can be named the way consumers already expect. `<loomi-progress-bar>`
  and `<loomi-progress-circle>` gain `label`, `<loomi-context-menu>` gains `label` for
  triggers whose slotted content is not text, and `<loomi-chat-window>` gains `locale`.

  Also fixed: `<loomi-autocomplete>` marks its input `role="combobox"` (`aria-expanded` was
  not permitted without it), `<loomi-context-menu>`'s target carries a button role,
  `<loomi-resizable-handle>` reports `aria-valuenow`, and the previously unnamed controls in
  `<loomi-pagination>`, `<loomi-colorpicker>`, `<loomi-filepicker>` and `<loomi-chat-window>`
  now have accessible names.

- 9344aad: Restore every form-associated control to its initial state through native form resets,
  document submitted value formats, and add generated React 18 and React 19 JSX types.

## 0.3.0

### Patch Changes

- @loomidev/core@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fe159c4: First public release of LoomiUI.

  All `@loomidev/*` packages share a single version number and are released together,
  so any set of them installed at the same version is mutually compatible.

  Versions stay in the `0.x` range while the component APIs settle. Until `1.0.0`,
  a minor bump may contain breaking changes; pin an exact version if you need
  stability across upgrades.

### Patch Changes

- 505ea39: Replace raw gray ramps and `#ffffff` fallbacks with semantic Loomi surface, border, and
  on-primary text tokens so components respect dark mode and theme overrides consistently.
- e1e36b7: Make corner radius and control density themeable from `:root`, closing the gap where a
  downloaded theme could recolor components but couldn't reshape them.

  `@loomidev/theme` now ships four public token slots (defaults preserve current rendering
  exactly, so this is additive — no visual change unless you override them):

  - `--loomi-control-radius` (default `0.5rem`) — inputs, selects, buttons, checkbox, tag,
    tabs, pagination, pin, and every field-style control.
  - `--loomi-panel-radius` (default `0.875rem`) — cards, modals, popovers, menus, dropdown
    panels, tables, notifications, statistic/checkcards.
  - `--loomi-pill-radius` (default `9999px`) — pill/`radius="full"` shapes and pill tags.
  - `--loomi-density` (default `1`) — a unitless multiplier scaling control height and
    horizontal padding together (font size stays fixed), e.g. `:root { --loomi-density: 0.85 }`
    for a compact UI. Composes with the per-`size` presets rather than replacing them.

  Precedence is per-instance attribute → `:root` theme override → built-in default: an
  explicit `radius="full"`/`size="small"` still wins over a global token, while the _default_
  preset now defers to the theme. `<loomi-button>`'s `radius` attribute is reimplemented on
  top of `--loomi-control-radius`/`--loomi-pill-radius` instead of fixed Tailwind classes;
  its markup API is unchanged. True geometry (circular avatars, spinners, toggles, chart/QR/
  credit-card art) is intentionally left fixed and does not read these tokens.
