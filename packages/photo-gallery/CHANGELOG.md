### Patch Changes

- 9344aad: Support server-side rendering. Every component now renders to Declarative Shadow DOM
  under `@lit-labs/ssr`, so a page can ship real, styled markup before any JavaScript runs
  — from Astro, Nuxt or Next.js, or as static HTML served by Rails, Laravel or Django.

  Sixteen components previously threw when rendered without a DOM, because they read light
  DOM children, measured layout, or wrote inline styles on the host during `render()`.
  Those reads are now guarded with lit's `isServer`. Components that derive content from
  light-DOM children (`<loomi-select>` with `<option>` elements, `<loomi-tabs>`,
  `<loomi-table>` with a `<template slot="row">`) render without that content on the server
  and fill it in at hydration; passing the same data through properties server-renders.

  `<loomi-timepicker>`'s clock stylesheet is now interpolated as a static value rather than
  a binding, since lit-html cannot bind inside a `<style>` element.

### Minor Changes

- fe159c4: First public release of LoomiUI.

  All `@loomidev/*` packages share a single version number and are released together,
  so any set of them installed at the same version is mutually compatible.

  Versions stay in the `0.x` range while the component APIs settle. Until `1.0.0`,
  a minor bump may contain breaking changes; pin an exact version if you need
  stability across upgrades.
