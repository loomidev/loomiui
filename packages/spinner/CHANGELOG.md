# @loomidev/spinner

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fe159c4: First public release of LoomiUI.

  All `@loomidev/*` packages share a single version number and are released together,
  so any set of them installed at the same version is mutually compatible.

  Versions stay in the `0.x` range while the component APIs settle. Until `1.0.0`,
  a minor bump may contain breaking changes; pin an exact version if you need
  stability across upgrades.

### Patch Changes

- 505ea39: Fix `type="spinner"` and `type="dot"` rendering nothing. Their fading lines/dots
  were generated as nested `html` template fragments inserted into an `<svg>`, which
  the browser parses in the HTML namespace instead of the SVG namespace, silently
  dropping the shapes. They now use Lit's `svg` tag function so the elements render
  correctly.
