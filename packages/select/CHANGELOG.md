# @loomidev/select

## 0.5.0

### Patch Changes

- ec8801a: Restore every form-associated control to its initial state through native form resets,
  document submitted value formats, and add generated React 18 and React 19 JSX types.
- 7227978: Support server-side rendering. Every component now renders to Declarative Shadow DOM
  under `@lit-labs/ssr`, so a page can ship real, styled markup before any JavaScript runs
  — from Astro, Nuxt or Next.js, or as static HTML served by Rails, Laravel or Django.

  Sixteen components previously threw when rendered without a DOM, because they read light
  DOM children, measured layout, or wrote inline styles on the host during `render()`.
  Those reads are now guarded with lit's `isServer`. Components that derive content from
  light-DOM children (`<loomi-select>` with `<option>` elements, `<loomi-tabs>`,
  `<loomi-table>` with a `<template slot="row">`) render without that content on the server
  and fill it in at hydration; passing the same data through properties server-renders.

  `<loomi-timepicker>`'s clock stylesheet is now interpolated as a static value rather than
  a binding, since lit-html cannot bind inside a `<style>` element.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fe159c4: First public release of LoomiUI.

  All `@loomidev/*` packages share a single version number and are released together,
  so any set of them installed at the same version is mutually compatible.

  Versions stay in the `0.x` range while the component APIs settle. Until `1.0.0`,
  a minor bump may contain breaking changes; pin an exact version if you need
  stability across upgrades.

### Patch Changes

- 263ce12: Fixed `<loomi-select>` discarding an empty `selected-value`. A filter whose unfiltered
  choice carries `value=""` — "All categories", "Any status" — was read as "nothing
  selected", so the trigger fell back to its placeholder instead of showing the option the
  caller had chosen. An empty value now counts when the options actually offer one, and
  the selection is re-resolved when `data` arrives after `selected-value`, which is the
  usual order in a framework binding.

  Gave `<loomi-button>` `delegatesFocus`. The host was not focusable, so `el.focus()` on it
  did nothing at all — a silent no-op that only surfaces in keyboard testing, and the
  reason a component needing to hand focus back to a button trigger had to reach through
  the shadow root for it. `<loomi-split-button>` already did this; the two now agree.

  Fixed `<loomi-button can-submit>` never submitting anything. It set `type="submit"` on
  its rendered `<button>` — but that button is inside the component's shadow root, and form
  association does not cross a shadow boundary, so a consumer's `<form>` in the light DOM
  never heard about it. Clicking did nothing at all: no error, no submit, just a form that
  would not send. It now walks out through its shadow hosts to find the owning form and
  calls `requestSubmit()`, so the form's validation and its `submit` listeners still run.

  Added `positionFloatingPanel()` to `@loomidev/core`, extracted from
  `<loomi-split-button>`. It places a panel beside its anchor in viewport coordinates,
  flipping and shifting to stay on screen, so components that take their panel out of flow
  share one implementation rather than each growing their own.

- 5644747: Make the vertical spacing below form fields themeable via a new `--loomi-field-spacing`
  token (default `1rem`). Stacked fields already shipped this margin on most components but not
  all — it's now consistent across every stacked field and overridable from `:root`:

  ```css
  :root {
    --loomi-field-spacing: 0; /* own field spacing yourself, e.g. via a flex/grid gap container */
  }
  ```

  `datepicker` and `timepicker` previously had no bottom margin and now match the other
  fields (a 1rem gap by default). `otp` (standalone/centered) and `colorpicker` (an inline
  swatch) intentionally keep no field margin. The per-instance `no-clearing` escape hatch is
  unchanged.

- e1e36b7: Make corner radius and control density themeable from `:root`, closing the gap where a
  downloaded theme could recolor components but couldn't reshape them.

  `@loomidev/theme` now ships four public token slots (defaults preserve current rendering
  exactly, so this is additive — no visual change unless you override them):

  - `--loomi-control-radius` (default `0.5rem`) — inputs, selects, buttons, checkbox, tag,
    tabs, pagination, pin, and every field-style control.
  - `--loomi-panel-radius` (default `0.875rem`) — cards, modals, popovers, menus, dropdown
    panels, tables, notifications, statistic/checkcards.
  - `--loomi-pill-radius` (default `9999px`) — pill/`radius="full"` shapes and pill tags.
  - `--loomi-density` (default `1`) — a unitless multiplier scaling control height and
    horizontal padding together (font size stays fixed), e.g. `:root { --loomi-density: 0.85 }`
    for a compact UI. Composes with the per-`size` presets rather than replacing them.

  Precedence is per-instance attribute → `:root` theme override → built-in default: an
  explicit `radius="full"`/`size="small"` still wins over a global token, while the _default_
  preset now defers to the theme. `<loomi-button>`'s `radius` attribute is reimplemented on
  top of `--loomi-control-radius`/`--loomi-pill-radius` instead of fixed Tailwind classes;
  its markup API is unchanged. True geometry (circular avatars, spinners, toggles, chart/QR/
  credit-card art) is intentionally left fixed and does not read these tokens.
