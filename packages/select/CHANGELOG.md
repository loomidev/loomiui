# @loomidev/select

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- f8d070d: `<loomi-select>` takes the same leading affix as `<loomi-input>`: `prefix`, `prefix-icon`, a `prefix` slot and `transparent-prefix`. The floating label and placeholder start after it.

### Patch Changes

- fde1da3: Visual fix: `<loomi-datepicker>` and `<loomi-timepicker>` labels now float onto the field's top border like `<loomi-input>` and `<loomi-select>`, and `label-position="inside"` lines up across every form control. `label-position="inside"` no longer reserves label space when `label` is empty, and an empty `<loomi-tag-input>` now matches the other controls' height. `@loomidev/core` adds `fieldLabelStyles`.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 29cce36: Form controls now follow the native value-and-events contract (documented in `@loomidev/core`'s README), so framework two-way bindings work on the tags directly.
  
  - `<loomi-select>` gains a settable `value` (comma-joined when `multiple`) and `values` (`string[]`), and fires `input` before `change` on every pick. Typing in its search box no longer fires `input` on the host, and a pick survives a later `data` swap.
  - `<loomi-checkbox>` and `<loomi-toggle>` expose a read-only `type` of `"checkbox"`, `<loomi-radio>` one of `"radio"`. All three fire `input` (with `checked` already updated) before `change`. Setting a radio's `checked` unchecks the rest of its group, as a native radio does.
  - `<loomi-otp>` gains a settable `value` and now fires `input` on each edit and `change` when focus leaves the boxes. Moving it in the DOM no longer clears the code.
  - `<loomi-datepicker>`, `<loomi-timepicker>` and `<loomi-slider>` turn their read-only `value` into a settable one. `<loomi-checkcards>` gains `value`/`values`. `<loomi-filepicker>` gains a native-style `value` (set `""` to clear). Each now fires `input` before `change` on user edits. The timepicker and checkcards honor `selected-value` changes after the first render, and the timepicker converts between 12- and 24-hour input.
  - `<loomi-input>`, `<loomi-password>`, `<loomi-textarea>`, `<loomi-number>`, `<loomi-autocomplete>`, `<loomi-tag-input>`, `<loomi-text-editor>` and `<loomi-slider>` fire exactly one `input` per edit (the inner field's native event used to leak through as a second one). Text fields re-sync when a listener rewrites `value` mid-edit.
  - `<loomi-text-editor>` fires `change` only when focus leaves after an edit, not on every blur. `<loomi-number>` no longer fires an extra `input` on commit unless the commit clamped the number. `<loomi-autocomplete>` commits typed free text with `change` on leaving the field. `<loomi-timepicker>` no longer fires `change` for a pick that leaves the time unchanged.
  - `@loomidev/react` wrappers gain `onInput` where the controls newly declare `input`.

### Patch Changes

- ee9d5a7: Cut what components cost a consumer bundle.
  
  - Icons load on demand. `@loomidev/icons` no longer inlines Heroicons: each icon is its own module, loaded the first time it renders, through the new `loomiIcon()` directive, `hasLoomiIcon()` and `loadLoomiIcon()`. `getLoomiIcon()` now returns only icons that are ready (registered, provided or already loaded). `import "@loomidev/icons/all"` restores the eager set. Components ship their own chrome icons statically via `provideLoomiIcons()`. The Heroicons set is now complete (324 icons per variant).
  - Iconsax and Untitled UI are opt-in: `import "@loomidev/icons/iconsax"` / `"@loomidev/icons/untitledui"`. Until then their names are unknown and `<loomi-icon>` falls back to its slot with a one-time console warning. `<loomi-text-editor>` registers the toolbar icons it uses, so it needs neither.
  - Every package declares `"sideEffects"` precisely, so bundlers tree-shake unused modules.
  - `@loomidev/button` safelists only the utility classes it builds at runtime; its compiled styles drop from 89 KB to 14 KB. The button is now about 8.4 KB min+gz including styles (was about 102 KB).
  - `LOOMI_CONTROL_SIZES` moved to core's `size` module (same export from `@loomidev/core`), so importing it no longer pulls in the field stylesheets.
  - Each README has a Bundle size section, and `pnpm check:bundle-size` reports every package's size in CI with a 10 KB hard limit on the button.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 661d4c0: **Breaking:** every `size` attribute (and `blur-size`, `image-size`, `icon-size`, `avatar-size`) now uses one ordered scale from `@loomidev/core`: `tiny` < `small` < `regular` < `medium` < `big` < `huge` < `omg`. A name means the same position in every component, every component defaults to `regular`, and an unsupported name renders as `regular`. The old names are removed, with no aliases.
  
  Renamed sizes:
  
  | Component                                  | Attribute    | Old → new                                                                                           |
  | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | modal                                      | `size`       | `medium` → `regular` (default), `large` → `big`, `xl` → `huge`                                      |
  | modal                                      | `blur-size`  | `medium` → `regular` (default), `large` → `big`, `xl` → `huge`                                      |
  | card                                       | `size`       | `default` → `regular`, `sm` → `small`                                                               |
  | drawer                                     | `size`       | `medium` → `regular` (default), `large` → `big`                                                     |
  | empty-state                                | `image-size` | `medium` → `regular` (default), `large` → `big`, `xl` → `huge`                                      |
  | side-nav                                   | `icon-size`  | `large` → `big`                                                                                     |
  | spinner                                    | `size`       | `small` → `regular` (default), `xl` → `huge`; the `sm`/`md`/`lg` aliases are removed                |
  | bell, otp                                  | `size`       | `small` → `regular` (default)                                                                       |
  | rating                                     | `size`       | `small` → `regular` (default)                                                                       |
  | progress-circle                            | `size`       | `medium` → `regular` (default), `large` → `huge`                                                    |
  | progress-arc                               | `size`       | `medium` → `regular` (default), `large` → `huge`                                                    |
  
  Resized:
  
  - **avatar:** `medium` moves from 2.5rem (smaller than `regular`) to 3.5rem, between `regular` (3rem, still the default) and `big` (4rem).
  - **fab:** `medium` moves from 3.25rem (smaller than `regular`) to 4.25rem, above `regular` (3.75rem, still the default).
  - **input, select, number, password, autocomplete, countries, tag-input, timepicker, timezonepicker, emoji-picker:** the default is now `regular` (was `medium`), so a default field is 2.5rem tall and lines up with a default `<loomi-button>`. Set `size="medium"` for the previous 2.75rem height. emoji-picker's `big` trigger is now 3rem, matching the other controls.
  
  Types: every size property is typed with the new `LoomiSize` export from `@loomidev/core` (so custom-elements.json and editor autocomplete show the same list everywhere), and the per-component size types are removed: `LoomiAutocompleteSize`, `LoomiAvatarSize`, `LoomiBellSize`, `LoomiButtonSize`, `LoomiButtonGroupSize`, `LoomiCardSize`, `LoomiColorpickerSize`, `LoomiCountriesSize`, `LoomiDatepickerSize`, `LoomiDrawerSize`, `LoomiEmojiPickerSize`, `LoomiEmptyImageSize`, `LoomiFabSize`, `LoomiInputSize`, `LoomiModalSize`, `LoomiNumberSize`, `LoomiPasswordSize`, `LoomiProgressStepSize`, `LoomiRatingSize`, `LoomiSelectSize`, `LoomiSideNavIconSize`, `LoomiSpinnerSize`, `LoomiSplitButtonSize`, `LoomiTagInputSize`, `LoomiTimezonepickerSize`. Use `LoomiSize` instead.
  
  New in `@loomidev/core`: `LOOMI_SIZES`, `LoomiSize`, `isLoomiSize`, `LOOMI_DEFAULT_SIZE`, `LOOMI_CONTROL_SIZES`, `resolveLoomiSize` and `LoomiSizeSupport`. Each sized component declares the names it supports in a static `supportedSizes` map. See the "Sizing" section of the core README.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- c952b7d: The trigger is now a WAI-ARIA select-only combobox: `role="combobox"` (was an implicit `button`) with `aria-controls` pointing at the option list while open, so `aria-activedescendant` is valid and the open select passes axe. `role="listbox"` moves from the panel wrapper to the option list itself, so the search box and empty-state action are no longer invalid listbox children. The combobox and listbox are named by the `label` (the value is read as the combobox's value); a select with no `label` can be named with a new `aria-label` attribute, forwarded from the host, and otherwise falls back to its placeholder. Fixes the axe `button-name` violation on placeholder-only selects. **Breaking for tests/automation:** queries for the trigger by `role=button` (e.g. Playwright `getByRole("button")`) must use `combobox`.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- fd109c2: The options panel now opens in the top layer, positioned against the trigger, so opening a select inside a modal (or any `overflow` container) no longer makes that container scroll. It flips above the field when there isn't room below and follows the field when an ancestor scrolls.

## 0.5.0

### Patch Changes

- ec8801a: Restore every form-associated control to its initial state through native form resets,
  document submitted value formats, and add generated React 18 and React 19 JSX types.
- 7227978: Support server-side rendering. Every component now renders to Declarative Shadow DOM
  under `@lit-labs/ssr`, so a page can ship real, styled markup before any JavaScript runs
  — from Astro, Nuxt or Next.js, or as static HTML served by Rails, Laravel or Django.

  Sixteen components previously threw when rendered without a DOM, because they read light
  DOM children, measured layout, or wrote inline styles on the host during `render()`.
  Those reads are now guarded with lit's `isServer`. Components that derive content from
  light-DOM children (`<loomi-select>` with `<option>` elements, `<loomi-tabs>`,
  `<loomi-table>` with a `<template slot="row">`) render without that content on the server
  and fill it in at hydration; passing the same data through properties server-renders.

  `<loomi-timepicker>`'s clock stylesheet is now interpolated as a static value rather than
  a binding, since lit-html cannot bind inside a `<style>` element.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fe159c4: First public release of LoomiUI.

  All `@loomidev/*` packages share a single version number and are released together,
  so any set of them installed at the same version is mutually compatible.

  Versions stay in the `0.x` range while the component APIs settle. Until `1.0.0`,
  a minor bump may contain breaking changes; pin an exact version if you need
  stability across upgrades.

### Patch Changes

- 263ce12: Fixed `<loomi-select>` discarding an empty `selected-value`. A filter whose unfiltered
  choice carries `value=""` — "All categories", "Any status" — was read as "nothing
  selected", so the trigger fell back to its placeholder instead of showing the option the
  caller had chosen. An empty value now counts when the options actually offer one, and
  the selection is re-resolved when `data` arrives after `selected-value`, which is the
  usual order in a framework binding.

  Gave `<loomi-button>` `delegatesFocus`. The host was not focusable, so `el.focus()` on it
  did nothing at all — a silent no-op that only surfaces in keyboard testing, and the
  reason a component needing to hand focus back to a button trigger had to reach through
  the shadow root for it. `<loomi-split-button>` already did this; the two now agree.

  Fixed `<loomi-button can-submit>` never submitting anything. It set `type="submit"` on
  its rendered `<button>` — but that button is inside the component's shadow root, and form
  association does not cross a shadow boundary, so a consumer's `<form>` in the light DOM
  never heard about it. Clicking did nothing at all: no error, no submit, just a form that
  would not send. It now walks out through its shadow hosts to find the owning form and
  calls `requestSubmit()`, so the form's validation and its `submit` listeners still run.

  Added `positionFloatingPanel()` to `@loomidev/core`, extracted from
  `<loomi-split-button>`. It places a panel beside its anchor in viewport coordinates,
  flipping and shifting to stay on screen, so components that take their panel out of flow
  share one implementation rather than each growing their own.

- 5644747: Make the vertical spacing below form fields themeable via a new `--loomi-field-spacing`
  token (default `1rem`). Stacked fields already shipped this margin on most components but not
  all — it's now consistent across every stacked field and overridable from `:root`:

  ```css
  :root {
    --loomi-field-spacing: 0; /* own field spacing yourself, e.g. via a flex/grid gap container */
  }
  ```

  `datepicker` and `timepicker` previously had no bottom margin and now match the other
  fields (a 1rem gap by default). `otp` (standalone/centered) and `colorpicker` (an inline
  swatch) intentionally keep no field margin. The per-instance `no-clearing` escape hatch is
  unchanged.

- e1e36b7: Make corner radius and control density themeable from `:root`, closing the gap where a
  downloaded theme could recolor components but couldn't reshape them.

  `@loomidev/theme` now ships four public token slots (defaults preserve current rendering
  exactly, so this is additive — no visual change unless you override them):

  - `--loomi-control-radius` (default `0.5rem`) — inputs, selects, buttons, checkbox, tag,
    tabs, pagination, pin, and every field-style control.
  - `--loomi-panel-radius` (default `0.875rem`) — cards, modals, popovers, menus, dropdown
    panels, tables, notifications, statistic/checkcards.
  - `--loomi-pill-radius` (default `9999px`) — pill/`radius="full"` shapes and pill tags.
  - `--loomi-density` (default `1`) — a unitless multiplier scaling control height and
    horizontal padding together (font size stays fixed), e.g. `:root { --loomi-density: 0.85 }`
    for a compact UI. Composes with the per-`size` presets rather than replacing them.

  Precedence is per-instance attribute → `:root` theme override → built-in default: an
  explicit `radius="full"`/`size="small"` still wins over a global token, while the _default_
  preset now defers to the theme. `<loomi-button>`'s `radius` attribute is reimplemented on
  top of `--loomi-control-radius`/`--loomi-pill-radius` instead of fixed Tailwind classes;
  its markup API is unchanged. True geometry (circular avatars, spinners, toggles, chart/QR/
  credit-card art) is intentionally left fixed and does not read these tokens.
