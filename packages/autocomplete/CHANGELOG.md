# @loomidev/autocomplete

## 0.5.0

### Patch Changes

- 450d1d3: Fix accessibility defects found by a new library-wide axe sweep, and retune the theme's
  text tokens so every tier meets WCAG AA contrast on both the light and dark surface —
  `--loomi-text-muted` and `--loomi-text-faint` each shift one step (darker in light mode,
  lighter in dark), which is visible wherever muted copy and placeholders are rendered.

  `<loomi-button>` now forwards an `aria-label` written on the host to the inner control,
  so icon-only buttons can be named the way consumers already expect. `<loomi-progress-bar>`
  and `<loomi-progress-circle>` gain `label`, `<loomi-context-menu>` gains `label` for
  triggers whose slotted content is not text, and `<loomi-chat-window>` gains `locale`.

  Also fixed: `<loomi-autocomplete>` marks its input `role="combobox"` (`aria-expanded` was
  not permitted without it), `<loomi-context-menu>`'s target carries a button role,
  `<loomi-resizable-handle>` reports `aria-valuenow`, and the previously unnamed controls in
  `<loomi-pagination>`, `<loomi-colorpicker>`, `<loomi-filepicker>` and `<loomi-chat-window>`
  now have accessible names.

- fdac5da: Expand native FormData integration coverage across scalar, choice, checked, range, date,
  and time controls. Input, password, and autocomplete now restore their initial values and
  clear transient state when their containing form is reset.
- ec8801a: Restore every form-associated control to its initial state through native form resets,
  document submitted value formats, and add generated React 18 and React 19 JSX types.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fe159c4: First public release of LoomiUI.

  All `@loomidev/*` packages share a single version number and are released together,
  so any set of them installed at the same version is mutually compatible.

  Versions stay in the `0.x` range while the component APIs settle. Until `1.0.0`,
  a minor bump may contain breaking changes; pin an exact version if you need
  stability across upgrades.

### Patch Changes

- 5644747: Make the vertical spacing below form fields themeable via a new `--loomi-field-spacing`
  token (default `1rem`). Stacked fields already shipped this margin on most components but not
  all — it's now consistent across every stacked field and overridable from `:root`:

  ```css
  :root {
    --loomi-field-spacing: 0; /* own field spacing yourself, e.g. via a flex/grid gap container */
  }
  ```

  `datepicker` and `timepicker` previously had no bottom margin and now match the other
  fields (a 1rem gap by default). `otp` (standalone/centered) and `colorpicker` (an inline
  swatch) intentionally keep no field margin. The per-instance `no-clearing` escape hatch is
  unchanged.
