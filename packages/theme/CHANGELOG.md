## 0.4.1

### Minor Changes

- 9344aad: Fix accessibility defects found by a new library-wide axe sweep, and retune the theme's
  text tokens so every tier meets WCAG AA contrast on both the light and dark surface —
  `--loomi-text-muted` and `--loomi-text-faint` each shift one step (darker in light mode,
  lighter in dark), which is visible wherever muted copy and placeholders are rendered.

  `<loomi-button>` now forwards an `aria-label` written on the host to the inner control,
  so icon-only buttons can be named the way consumers already expect. `<loomi-progress-bar>`
  and `<loomi-progress-circle>` gain `label`, `<loomi-context-menu>` gains `label` for
  triggers whose slotted content is not text, and `<loomi-chat-window>` gains `locale`.

  Also fixed: `<loomi-autocomplete>` marks its input `role="combobox"` (`aria-expanded` was
  not permitted without it), `<loomi-context-menu>`'s target carries a button role,
  `<loomi-resizable-handle>` reports `aria-valuenow`, and the previously unnamed controls in
  `<loomi-pagination>`, `<loomi-colorpicker>`, `<loomi-filepicker>` and `<loomi-chat-window>`
  now have accessible names.

### Minor Changes

- fe159c4: First public release of LoomiUI.

  All `@loomidev/*` packages share a single version number and are released together,
  so any set of them installed at the same version is mutually compatible.

  Versions stay in the `0.x` range while the component APIs settle. Until `1.0.0`,
  a minor bump may contain breaking changes; pin an exact version if you need
  stability across upgrades.

- 5644747: Make the vertical spacing below form fields themeable via a new `--loomi-field-spacing`
  token (default `1rem`). Stacked fields already shipped this margin on most components but not
  all — it's now consistent across every stacked field and overridable from `:root`:

  ```css
  :root {
    --loomi-field-spacing: 0; /* own field spacing yourself, e.g. via a flex/grid gap container */
  }
  ```

  `datepicker` and `timepicker` previously had no bottom margin and now match the other
  fields (a 1rem gap by default). `otp` (standalone/centered) and `colorpicker` (an inline
  swatch) intentionally keep no field margin. The per-instance `no-clearing` escape hatch is
  unchanged.

- e1e36b7: Make corner radius and control density themeable from `:root`, closing the gap where a
  downloaded theme could recolor components but couldn't reshape them.

  `@loomidev/theme` now ships four public token slots (defaults preserve current rendering
  exactly, so this is additive — no visual change unless you override them):

  - `--loomi-control-radius` (default `0.5rem`) — inputs, selects, buttons, checkbox, tag,
    tabs, pagination, pin, and every field-style control.
  - `--loomi-panel-radius` (default `0.875rem`) — cards, modals, popovers, menus, dropdown
    panels, tables, notifications, statistic/checkcards.
  - `--loomi-pill-radius` (default `9999px`) — pill/`radius="full"` shapes and pill tags.
  - `--loomi-density` (default `1`) — a unitless multiplier scaling control height and
    horizontal padding together (font size stays fixed), e.g. `:root { --loomi-density: 0.85 }`
    for a compact UI. Composes with the per-`size` presets rather than replacing them.

  Precedence is per-instance attribute → `:root` theme override → built-in default: an
  explicit `radius="full"`/`size="small"` still wins over a global token, while the _default_
  preset now defers to the theme. `<loomi-button>`'s `radius` attribute is reimplemented on
  top of `--loomi-control-radius`/`--loomi-pill-radius` instead of fixed Tailwind classes;
  its markup API is unchanged. True geometry (circular avatars, spinners, toggles, chart/QR/
  credit-card art) is intentionally left fixed and does not read these tokens.

### Patch Changes

- 49b905b: Changed the default `warning` palette ramp from Tailwind's `orange` to `amber`. The
  previous default sat only ~14° apart in hue from `error`'s `red` ramp at a similar
  lightness/chroma, making the two easy to mix up at a glance (and especially hard to
  tell apart for red-green colorblind users). `amber` (~58° hue) reads as a conventional
  "caution" color and is clearly distinct from `error` in every component that uses
  `color="warning"`. Purely a default-value change — the `--loomi-warning-*` token names
  are unchanged, so any app that already overrides them is unaffected.
