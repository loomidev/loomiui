### Patch Changes

- ee9d5a7: Cut what components cost a consumer bundle.
  
  - Icons load on demand. `@loomidev/icons` no longer inlines Heroicons: each icon is its own module, loaded the first time it renders, through the new `loomiIcon()` directive, `hasLoomiIcon()` and `loadLoomiIcon()`. `getLoomiIcon()` now returns only icons that are ready (registered, provided or already loaded). `import "@loomidev/icons/all"` restores the eager set. Components ship their own chrome icons statically via `provideLoomiIcons()`. The Heroicons set is now complete (324 icons per variant).
  - Iconsax and Untitled UI are opt-in: `import "@loomidev/icons/iconsax"` / `"@loomidev/icons/untitledui"`. Until then their names are unknown and `<loomi-icon>` falls back to its slot with a one-time console warning. `<loomi-text-editor>` registers the toolbar icons it uses, so it needs neither.
  - Every package declares `"sideEffects"` precisely, so bundlers tree-shake unused modules.
  - `@loomidev/button` safelists only the utility classes it builds at runtime; its compiled styles drop from 89 KB to 14 KB. The button is now about 8.4 KB min+gz including styles (was about 102 KB).
  - `LOOMI_CONTROL_SIZES` moved to core's `size` module (same export from `@loomidev/core`), so importing it no longer pulls in the field stylesheets.
  - Each README has a Bundle size section, and `pnpm check:bundle-size` reports every package's size in CI with a 10 KB hard limit on the button.

### Minor Changes

- 742f156: Make the last five components with hardcoded English translatable. `<loomi-chat-window>`,
  `<loomi-command-palette>`, `<loomi-data-grid>`, `<loomi-filter-builder>` and `<loomi-video>`
  each gain a `locale` property and route their own copy through the translation table, with
  new `en` keys for all of it.

  The gap was worst for text a consumer could not reach: `aria-label` values baked into
  templates were fixed English with no way to override them, which left screen reader users
  of a non-English page hearing "Select all rows" and "Search commands" regardless of the
  locale. Visible defaults (`emptyTitle`, `placeholder`, `addLabel`, …) now resolve through
  `loomiDefaultText`, so they translate while still yielding to any value a consumer sets.

### Patch Changes

- 87c5d42: Document the events that were missing from the custom-elements manifests. The analyzer
  only sees `new CustomEvent("literal-name")`, so events dispatched through a helper or a
  template literal — all nine `<loomi-data-grid>` events, the three
  `<loomi-date-range-picker>` events, `loomi-command-query-change`, `loomi-filter-apply`,
  `loomi-reminder-create`, the `<loomi-chat-window>` attachment and recording events, and
  `<loomi-input>`'s affix events — never reached `custom-elements.json`, and so never
  reached the React wrappers either. They are now declared with `@fires` and generate typed
  `on*` callback props.

  `<loomi-empty-state>` documented a `loomi-action` event it never fires; its JSDoc now
  names the `action` event the component actually dispatches.

### Patch Changes

- @loomidev/core@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fe159c4: First public release of LoomiUI.

  All `@loomidev/*` packages share a single version number and are released together,
  so any set of them installed at the same version is mutually compatible.

  Versions stay in the `0.x` range while the component APIs settle. Until `1.0.0`,
  a minor bump may contain breaking changes; pin an exact version if you need
  stability across upgrades.

### Patch Changes

- 505ea39: Replace raw gray ramps and `#ffffff` fallbacks with semantic Loomi surface, border, and
  on-primary text tokens so components respect dark mode and theme overrides consistently.
