# @loomidev/tag

## 0.10.0

### Patch Changes

- ee9d5a7: Cut what components cost a consumer bundle.
  
  - Icons load on demand. `@loomidev/icons` no longer inlines Heroicons: each icon is its own module, loaded the first time it renders, through the new `loomiIcon()` directive, `hasLoomiIcon()` and `loadLoomiIcon()`. `getLoomiIcon()` now returns only icons that are ready (registered, provided or already loaded). `import "@loomidev/icons/all"` restores the eager set. Components ship their own chrome icons statically via `provideLoomiIcons()`. The Heroicons set is now complete (324 icons per variant).
  - Iconsax and Untitled UI are opt-in: `import "@loomidev/icons/iconsax"` / `"@loomidev/icons/untitledui"`. Until then their names are unknown and `<loomi-icon>` falls back to its slot with a one-time console warning. `<loomi-text-editor>` registers the toolbar icons it uses, so it needs neither.
  - Every package declares `"sideEffects"` precisely, so bundlers tree-shake unused modules.
  - `@loomidev/button` safelists only the utility classes it builds at runtime; its compiled styles drop from 89 KB to 14 KB. The button is now about 8.4 KB min+gz including styles (was about 102 KB).
  - `LOOMI_CONTROL_SIZES` moved to core's `size` module (same export from `@loomidev/core`), so importing it no longer pulls in the field stylesheets.
  - Each README has a Bundle size section, and `pnpm check:bundle-size` reports every package's size in CI with a 10 KB hard limit on the button.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 450d1d3: Export a typed `EventMap` (and named detail interfaces) from fourteen more component
  packages. `@loomidev/react` derives each `on*` callback's type from these, so events on
  these components now carry a typed `detail` instead of falling back to `any`.

### Patch Changes

- ae725e5: Deepen component test coverage. Eleven packages that carried one to three smoke tests now
  cover their actual behavior: pagination's page arithmetic, boundary clamping and ellipsis
  collapsing; accordion's single-open and multi-open semantics; autocomplete's filtering,
  arrow-key wrapping and Enter selection; rating, toggle, textarea, number and tag form
  participation; tooltip placement; and listview and statistic rendering.

  One case documents behavior that was previously untested and is easy to trip over:
  `<loomi-tags>` ties selection to form participation, so an instance without a `name`
  ignores `selected-value` and marks nothing selectable.

- ec8801a: Restore every form-associated control to its initial state through native form resets,
  document submitted value formats, and add generated React 18 and React 19 JSX types.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fe159c4: First public release of LoomiUI.

  All `@loomidev/*` packages share a single version number and are released together,
  so any set of them installed at the same version is mutually compatible.

  Versions stay in the `0.x` range while the component APIs settle. Until `1.0.0`,
  a minor bump may contain breaking changes; pin an exact version if you need
  stability across upgrades.

### Patch Changes

- e1e36b7: Make corner radius and control density themeable from `:root`, closing the gap where a
  downloaded theme could recolor components but couldn't reshape them.

  `@loomidev/theme` now ships four public token slots (defaults preserve current rendering
  exactly, so this is additive — no visual change unless you override them):

  - `--loomi-control-radius` (default `0.5rem`) — inputs, selects, buttons, checkbox, tag,
    tabs, pagination, pin, and every field-style control.
  - `--loomi-panel-radius` (default `0.875rem`) — cards, modals, popovers, menus, dropdown
    panels, tables, notifications, statistic/checkcards.
  - `--loomi-pill-radius` (default `9999px`) — pill/`radius="full"` shapes and pill tags.
  - `--loomi-density` (default `1`) — a unitless multiplier scaling control height and
    horizontal padding together (font size stays fixed), e.g. `:root { --loomi-density: 0.85 }`
    for a compact UI. Composes with the per-`size` presets rather than replacing them.

  Precedence is per-instance attribute → `:root` theme override → built-in default: an
  explicit `radius="full"`/`size="small"` still wins over a global token, while the _default_
  preset now defers to the theme. `<loomi-button>`'s `radius` attribute is reimplemented on
  top of `--loomi-control-radius`/`--loomi-pill-radius` instead of fixed Tailwind classes;
  its markup API is unchanged. True geometry (circular avatars, spinners, toggles, chart/QR/
  credit-card art) is intentionally left fixed and does not read these tokens.
