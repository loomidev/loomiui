Add `iconsax` (outline/solid/twotone) and `untitledui` (outline) icon sets, selected via the new `<loomi-icon source="...">` attribute (`heroicons` stays the default). Unlike Heroicons, these ship as real `.svg` files fetched and cached on demand instead of being inlined as JS, so using one icon from either set doesn't bundle the other few thousand.
